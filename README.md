## ⭐ Overview

The **Adaptive Causal Digital Twin** is an end-to-end platform for modeling, simulating, understanding, and optimizing complex systems such as:

- cities  
- supply chains  
- networks / infrastructure  
- manufacturing systems  
- healthcare systems  
- energy grids  
- mobility / transportation  

Unlike traditional digital twins that only *predict*, this twin can also **understand why**, via causal reasoning, and **recommend optimal interventions**, via reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization.
